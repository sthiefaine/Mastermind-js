# MaterMind Game in JS

## Online demo available at: [Mastermind Javascript](https://thiefainedev.000webhostapp.com/)


The website can have some css troubles cause i'm updating it to try new things.

It's mobile first website.

A **night mode** is used by default but you can switch to the white theme if u **click** on the ball **in the top left corner**.

This mastermind will be adapted in react.
